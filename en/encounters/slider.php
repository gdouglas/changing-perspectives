                &ldquo;What were the Indigenous people&rsquo;s meetings with
                the fur traders like?&rdquo;(The title is white on a black
                background with a chalkboard-like font. All following images

            <h2>Panel 3</h2>
            <p>
                &ldquo;For several decades the fur trade was the main
                concern of European + US ships entering the region&mldr;This
                trade decimated the sea otter population. Ship&rsquo;s crews
                used force at times to ensure compliance, even taking
                hostages.&rdquo; (Hand-drawn, black and white drawing of two
                sea otters swimming.)

            <p>
                &ldquo;The Russians began trading with the Aleut in 1741. They
                took families hostage &amp; forced hunters to gather sea otters.
                In 1763, Aleuts revolted + destroyed 4 of 5 Russian ships. In
                retaliation, many Aleut villagers were massacred.&rdquo; (A
                Russian in a fur hat holds a musket at an Aleut villager
                who&rsquo;s hands are up in surrender. In the background is a
                sail ship.)

            <h2>Panel 5</h2>
            <p>
                &ldquo;As the Russians ravaged the Aleut &amp; sea otter
                populations, they began moving south into Tlingit territory. But
                the Tlingit were much better armed from trading with British
                &amp; American ships. The most sought-after trade items were
                guns &amp; ammo. Throughout the Coast, women conducted most of
                the trade negotiations.&rdquo; (Three Tlingit armed with muskets
                face-off a European on a sail ship. The European is in a jacket
                and also armed with a musket.)

            <p>
                &ldquo;As more ships descended on the region throughout the
                1780s &amp; &lsquo;90s, more ships were attacked. Over the next
                30 years dozens of ships would be captured.&rdquo; (Warriors in
                traditional armour with spears and clubs board the side of a

                In 1803, the US ship Boston was attacked by Mowachaht &amp;
                Muchalaht warriors, who killed 25 or 27 crew members. The 2
                survivors were forced to identify the severed heads of the crew.
                They were enslaved for 2 years&mldr;&rdquo; (On the side of a
                ship is a row of severed heads. Warriors face them holding

                warriors led with Wickaninnish in Clayoquot Sound. A surviving
                crew member rigged explosives &amp; escaped. THe blast killed as
                many as 100 Tla-o-qui-aht. (Three Tla-o-qui-aht watch in
