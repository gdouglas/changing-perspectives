                            On-screen text appears: A Northwest Passage.)<br />
                            A narrator reads out a journal entry: &ldquo;There
                            can be little doubt of there being a Northern
                            communication of some sort, by sea, between this
                            West side of America and the East side, through
                            Baffin&rsquo;s Bay.&rdquo; Captain James Cook,
                            Aleutian Islands, October 1778.<br />
                            (The journal entry appears in cursive, overtop a
                            drawing of a ship.)<br />
                            The Narrator says: Britain was challenging
                            Spain&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over the region
                            in their attempts to find the Northwest Passage. As
                            early as 1592, Juan de Fuca, a great mariner
                            employed by Spain, believed he had found a route
                            here. <br />
                            (A historical cartographic map is displayed. It has
                            a very detailed Asia, but North America is roughly
                            outlined with few details. The map shows where Juan
                            de Fuca sailed around the 49th parallel). <br />
                            Narrator: There were also stories of a possible
                            route found by the Spanish admiral, Bartholomew de
                            Fonte, in this location, in 1640. <br />
                            (On the same cartographic map, another route is
                            shown at about 53&deg; north.)<br />
                            Narrator: The Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company employed
                            Samuel Hearne and Matonabbee, a Dene guide, to
                            explore overland routes. They reached the Arctic
                            Ocean, at the mouth of the Coppermine River in
                            1771.<br />
                            (An animated map shows a circuitous route Samuel
                            Hearne and Matonabbee took leaving from Fort Prince
                            of Wales on the west side of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
                            and back. After, a second route is shown leaving
                            from Fort Prince of Wales north to the Arctic Ocean,
                            and then back to Hudson&rsquo;s Bay.)<br />
                            Narrator: Around the same time, maps showing Russian
                            discoveries gave rise to the idea of a clearwater
                            passage to the north and east, across the top of
                            America. Could a passage be this far north? <br />
                            (On the same cartographic map, a route is drawn
                            north between Russia and what is now Alaska into the
                            Arctic Ocean.)<br />
                            Narrator: The British speculated it was likely, and
                            commissioned Captain James Cook to investigate. In
                            January 1778, the expedition reached Hawai&rsquo;i.

                            British at that time).)<br />
                            Narrator: They were the first Europeans to visit and
                            map the archipelago. <br />

                            shown.)<br />
                            Narrator: Cook was welcomed by hundreds of islanders
                            as an honoured guest. <br />

                            Narrator: Some believe the Hawai&rsquo;ians thought
                            that Cook was an incarnation of the Polynesian god
                            Lono.<br />

                            around.)<br />
                            Narrator: By March, the expedition was approaching
                            the Northwest Coast. They were thwarted by
                            storms.<br />
                            (An animated map shows Captain Cook's route from
                            Hawai&rsquo;i across the Pacific Ocean to the
                            Northwest Coast of North America.)<br />
                            Narrator: Consequently, they missed Juan de
                            Fuca&rsquo;s Strait, and were too far offshore to
                            look for Admiral Fonte&rsquo;s Passage. Cook&rsquo;s
                            journal shows he was skeptical about both these
                            routes. <br />
                            The narrator reads out a journal entry: &ldquo;for
                            my own part, I give no credit to such vague and
                            improbable stories.&rdquo; Captain James Cook, May
                            1778. <br />

                            Northwest Coast depicts Cook&rsquo;s zagged route
                            along the coast.)<br />
                            Narrator: The ships anchored near the village of
                            Yuquot. Cook mistakenly named the village Nootka,
                            having misinterpreted the Mowachaht people when he
                            arrived. <br />
                            The narrator reads out a journal entry: &ldquo;They
                            would paddle&#8230;round both ships. A chief or
                            other principal person standing up with a
                            spear&#8230;they would come alongside and begin to
                            trade without further ceremony&#8230;their articles
                            were the skins of animals, in particular the Sea
                            Beaver [Otter]...&rdquo; Captain James Cook, April
                            1778, Ship Cove. <br />

                            sea otter from Captain Cook&rsquo;s voyage.)<br />
                            Narrator: The sailors traded with the Mowachaht
                            people for supplies of wood, water, oil, fish, and
                            furs, in exchange for mainly metal objects, a rare
                            material in Yuquot. <br />

                            Cook&rsquo;s ships anchored in Yuquot, with forested
                            mountains and Mowachaht canoes around.)<br />
                            Narrator: During their stay, John Webber and other
                            ship artists made detailed drawings documenting life
                            in the community. These would later appear as
                            engravings in the expedition&rsquo;s published
                            journal, which became a defacto guidebook in the
                            region. <br />

                            Narrator: After nearly a month a Yuquot, Cook
                            resumed his survey and renaming of the Northwest
                            Coast. They were in Prince William Sound by May,
                            Cook Inlet in June, and Icy Cape by August. <br />
                            (The cartographic map of the Northwest Coast shows
                            Cook&rsquo;s route along the coast. Prince William
                            Sound and Cook Inlet are both on the southern side
                            of Alaska, whereas Icy Cape is in the Arctic at 70
                            degrees North.)<br />
                            Narrator: Cook was convinced the Passage was at 71
                            degrees North, but ice prevented them sailing
                            further. The expedition returned to Hawai&rsquo;i in
                            January 1779 for repairs and supplies. Although they
                            were welcomed back at first, a disagreement
                            followed, and Cook was killed by the
                            Hawai&rsquo;ians on February 14th.<br />

                            background.)<br />
                            Narrator: The crew continued their mission. On their
                            way home, they learned that the sea otter pelts they
                            purchased in Yuquot could sell for a huge profit in
                            China. A good pelt sold for $120. That&rsquo;s worth
                            almost $3,000 today. <br />
                            (An animated map shows that the crew sailed from
                            Hawai&rsquo;i up north along the coast of Asia, then
                            south to China.)<br />
                            Narrator: The sea otter story attracted a lot of
                            interest among British Navy sailors. Many of them
                            were on half-pay after the American Revolutionary
                            War ended in 1783. In 1785, the first British fur
                            trading ship arrived in Yuquot. The following
                            summer, seven British fur traders were in the area.
                            Fortunes were made.<br />
                            (A map shows Yuquot on a large island on the Pacific
                            Northwest Coast, at about 49 degrees North.)<br />
                            Narrator: In 1787, Captain Nathaniel Portlock and
                            George Dixon sold 2,552 furs for $54,875 in Canton.
                            That&rsquo;s worth about $1.4 million today. The
                            Indigenous communities&rsquo; long-established trade
                            networks quickly included British and American
                            goods. A number of trade-centres emerged among the
                            coastal communities. <br />
                            (On a map of the Pacific Northwest Coast, the nearby
                            trade centres of Yuquot and Clayoquot Sound are

                            grew with their increased wealth. <br />

                            Nation is interviewed on screen, with an enlarged
                            sketch behind of an ancestral village.)<br />
                            Chief Michael Maquinna: &ldquo;Initially, it was not
                            a bad thing to begin with. However, as time had gone
                            on, we realized that perhaps it didn&rsquo;t turn
                            out so well for First Nation people.&rdquo;<br />
                            Narrator: In 1788, financed by a conglomerate of
                            British and Asian trading companies, John Meares, a
                            former Royal Navy lieutenant, arrived in Yuquot. He
                            built a schooner there and claimed he bought land
                            from the Mowachaht Chief Maquinna to build a trading
                            post. <br />

                            Maquinna in a woven regalia hat and John Meares.)<br />
                            Narrator: By the spring of 1789, several American
                            and British fur traders were anchored in Yuquot.
                            Spain was increasingly concerned about its
                            sovereignty claims over the region. In addition to
                            the growing British presence, they were monitoring
                            Russia&rsquo;s fur trading activities in the
                            Aleutian Islands. An expedition there in 1788
                            reported that the Russians had expanded their
                            networks significantly. Six new trading posts and a
                            large settlement on Kodiak Island. <br />
                            (A map shows the Aleutian Islands on the southern
                            part of what is now Alaska and Kodiak Island to the
                            east.)<br />
                            Narrator: In May, 1789, two Spanish frigates arrived
                            in Yuquot commanded by Captain Esteban Jos&eacute;
                            Mart&iacute;nez. They officially took possession of
                            the Cove and built a gun battery at the harbour
                            entrance. <br />
                            (A drawing shows a trading post with a flag in the
                            Cove.)<br />
                            Narrator: Later, the Argonaut fur trader arrived in
                            July with Chinese labourers and supplies for John
                            Meares trading post. An argument erupted between
                            Mart&iacute;nez and the ship&rsquo;s captain, James
                            Colnett. Accusing the British fur traders of
