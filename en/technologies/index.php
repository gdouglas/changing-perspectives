                        <p>Brass <strong>sextant</strong> with five eyepieces, made by Jesse Ramsden, was used by Joseph Baker, Vancouver’s First Lieutenant and is on loan courtesy of Richard Baker. The sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument with a graduated arc of 60° and a sighting mechanism, used for measuring the angular distances between objects and especially for taking altitudes in navigation.</p>

                        <p>John Arnold (maker) <strong>"Arnold 176" chronometer</strong> used by George Vancouver for 1790 expedition into Pacific Northwest. Completed in 1791 for the Board of Longitude, now in gimbal suspension with 3 tier mahogany case, purchased from Christie’s Auction House.</p>
                        <p>A marine Chronometer is a timepiece that is precise and accurate enough to be used as a portable time standard, meaning it can be used to determine longitude by accurately measuring the time of a known fixed location. When first developed in the 18th century, it was a major technical achievement, as accurate knowledge of the time during sea voyage is necessary for navigation without the use of electronic or communication devices.</p>
