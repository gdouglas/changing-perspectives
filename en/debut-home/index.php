                The Pacific North West Coast was in the midst of great changes when George Vancouver arrived there in 1792. The
                Indigenous Communities were engaged in a turbulent fur trade with the Europeans and the Americans. At the
                same time, the Spanish, Russian and British colonial empires were competing to take "possession" of the region.
