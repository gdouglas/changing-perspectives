                    <p>Heiltsuk Rock Art, ca. unknown</p>
                    <p>Haíɫzaqv (Heiltsuk) painted rock faces at villages and other sites within their respective territories. Artists used red dyes from local plants to illustrate family crests, coppers, and possibly historical events. Heiltsuk archaeologist Q̓íx̌itasu (Elroy White)thinks this artcould represent several things, such as the whaleboats used by Vancouver's expedition to map the territory, or the mouth of a sea monster.</p>
                    <p>Collectively, this body of rock art marks the Heiltsuk's historical and unbroken occupation of their territory.</p>

                        <p>Historic Sites and Monuments Board Yuquot Plaque, 2002</p>
                        <p>These plaques share the importance of Yuquot from the Mowachaht's perspective. Ha'wilth (Chief) Ambrose Maquinna wanted to replace the older 1923 National Historic Sites plaque that did not mention Chief Maquinna or the Mowachaht people. There are two new plaques: one is translated in Mowachaht and Spanish, the other in English and French. Both plaques are attached to cedar log carvings of a wolf made by Sanford Williams. In the Mowachaht culture, wolves are known as protectors of the land.</p>

                        <p>To the Mowachaht-Muchalaht First Nations, Yuquot has always been the centre of their social, political and economic world. Whaling was a vital part of the life of the Mowachaht-Muchalaht, and of all the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples. Near here once stood the Whalers Washing House, a unique ceremonial structure and the most significant monument to a purification ritual on the West Coast of North America. In the late 18th century, Yuquot became an important site of early contact between First Peoples and Europeans. Explorers and traders were attracted to this safe harbour, which they called Friendly Cove. As a result, Yuquot, also known as Nootka, developed into an important centre of trade and diplomacy, and it was briefly the site of Spain's only military establishment in present-day Canada. Yuquot became the focal point of the Nootka Sound Controversy of 1789-1794, when the rival interests of Great Britain and Spain brought those countries to the brink of war.</p>
