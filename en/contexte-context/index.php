                                <p>&ldquo;The evening of April the 29th brought us to an anchor in very thick rainy weather, about eight miles within the entrance on the southern shore of the supposed Straits of De Fuca. The following morning&hellip; a gentle breeze sprang up from the North West&hellip; which presented to our view this renowned inlet&rdquo;</p>
                                <p>Captain Vancouver came to the Pacific North West Coast in 1792 to complete the last in a series of European expeditions.</p>
                                <p>Why were the Europeans undertaking these journeys?</p>
                                <p>To understand that, we need to wind the clock back 400 years.</p>
                                <p>For centuries trade with Asia for spices and cloth had gone along the Silk Road.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>To increase their profits, the Europeans began looking for a sea route.</p>
                                <p>Christopher Columbus thought he had found it when he sailed west in 1492 &ndash; although unknowingly he had only reached the Caribbean.</p>
                                <p>Vasco da Gama did make it to Asia when he sailed east around Africa to reach India in 1498.</p>
                                <p>These explorers were willing to trade with the people they encountered but took what they wanted by force if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Pope Alexander VI gave the Portuguese and Spanish the &ldquo;God given right&rdquo; to claim ownership of the new lands.</p>
                                <p>At the Treaty of Tordesillas, they agreed to divide the new world between themselves. Portugal would have all lands East of the Cape Verde Islands and Spain all lands to the West.</p>
                                <p>With the Pope&rsquo;s blessing, the Spanish and Portuguese explorers saw themselves as bringing the Christian religion to the people they encountered whether they wanted it or not!</p>
                                <p>In Central and South America, the Spanish conquistadores conspired with rival indigenous groups to overwhelm the Aztec and Incan civilizations.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>The Spanish plundered gold and silver from these communities estimated at 11 billion dollars in today&rsquo;s money.</p>
                                <p>The Portuguese and Spanish also established sugar plantations in Brazil and in the Caribbean. They enslaved the Indigenous populations to work in these plantations and sold the sugar at a huge profit in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Once the Indigenous populations were decimated, they traded with African Coastal tribes for enslaved African men, women and children to provide the labor they needed.</p>
                                <p>In the 17th century, Holland, Britain and France began to challenge Spain and Portugal&rsquo;s control over trade with the New World.</p>
                                <p>The Dutch took over the spice trade in the East Indies.</p>
                                <p>The British established plantations and colonies in the Caribbean and along the east coast of North America.</p>
                                <p>In 1670 they established the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Fur Trading monopoly.</p>
                                <p>France began trading in India, established plantations in the Caribbean, and the territory of New France with Quebec City at the centre.</p>
                                <p>By 1730, the European trading networks had become truly global, concentrating on an Atlantic trading triangle.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Enslaved people became the core source of profit for all the European powers. By the 18th century over 6.5 million Africans had been captured and transported.</p>
                                <p>Life expectancy on the plantations was low. In the sugar plantations of Saint-Domingue, 30,000 enslaved Africans arrived annually; half of them would die within 3 to 8 years.</p>
                                <p>The Europeans powers fought over each other&rsquo;s colonies in the 7 Years War &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first truly global conflict.</p>
                                <p>France lost Quebec City to the British in 1759 at Battle of the Plains of Abraham.&nbsp; And consequently, gave up its North American territory to Britain and Spain in a peace treaty signed in Paris in 1763.</p>
                                <p>With their imperial dominance secure, the British commissioned the first of three expeditions to complete the mapping of the Pacific, and ideally find a faster sea route to Asia through North America &ndash; the Northwest Passage.</p>
                                <p>The expedition was led by Captain James Cook a skilled map maker and navigator. Over seven years and two expeditions, Cook drew the first maps of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. He also confirmed that, other than Antarctica, there were no other southern continents.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>In the age of colonial conquest, maps were an important source of wealth. Indigenous territories became unrecorded blank spaces which the Europeans would claim as their own.</p>
                                <p>Cook&rsquo;s expeditions were sponsored by the Royal Society &ndash; a British Scientific Academy.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;In addition to maps, these expeditions returned with carefully documented information provided by scientists and artists about the people they, met and the plants and animals they encountered.</p>
                                <p>Official journals were published and widely read by the general public. Cook became a national hero.</p>
                                <p>With mapping of the Southern Pacific complete, would Cook now complete his mission and return to find the Northwest Passage?</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;&hellip;there can be little doubt of there being a Northern communication of some sort, by sea, between this West side of America and the East side, through Baffin's Bay&hellip;</p>
                                <p>Captain James Cook, Aleutian Islands, October 1778.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Britain was challenging Spain&rsquo;s claim to sovereignty over the region and their attempts to find the North West passage.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>As early as 1592, Juan de Fuca, a Greek mariner employed by Spain, believed he had found a route here.</p>
                                <p>There were also stories of a possible route found by the Spanish Admiral Bartholomew de Fonte in this location in 1640.</p>
                                <p>The Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company employed Samuel Hearne and Montanobe, a Dene guide, to explore overland routes. They reached the Arctic Ocean at the mouth of the Coppermine river in 1771.</p>
                                <p>Around the same time, maps showing Russian discoveries gave rise to the idea of a clear water passage to the north and east across the top of America.</p>
                                <p>Could a passage be this far north?</p>
                                <p>The British speculated it was likely, and commissioned Captain James Cook to investigate.</p>
                                <p>In January 1778 the expedition reached Hawai&rsquo;i.</p>
                                <p>They were the first Europeans to visit and map the archipelago.</p>
                                <p>Cook was welcomed by hundreds of islanders as an honored guest.</p>
                                <p>Some believe the Hawaiian&rsquo;s thought that Cook was an incarnation of the Polynesian god Lono.</p>
                                <p>By March the expedition was approaching the Northwest coast. They were thwarted by storms.</p>
                                <p>Consequently, they missed Juan de Fuca&rsquo;s strait, and were too far offshore to look for Admiral Fonte&rsquo;s passage.</p>
                                <p>Cook&rsquo;s journal shows he was skeptical about both of these routes.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;For my own part, I give no credet to such vague and improbable stories.&rdquo;</p>
                                <p>The ships anchored near the village of Yuquot- Cook mistakenly named the village Nootka having misinterpreted the Mowachaht people when he arrived.</p>
                                <p>&ldquo;They would paddle &hellip; round both ships. A chief or other principal person standing up with a spear. &hellip; they would come along side and begin to trade without further ceremony&hellip; their articles were the skins of animals, in particular the Sea [Otter] Beaver.</p>
                                <p>Captain Cook, April 1778, Ship Cove.</p>
                                <p>The sailors traded with the Mowachaht people for supplies of wood, water, oil, fish and furs in exchange for mainly metal objects &ndash; a rare material in Yuquot.</p>
                                <p>During their stay, John Webber and other ship&rsquo;s artists made detailed drawings documenting life in the community.</p>
                                <p>These would later appear as engravings in the expedition&rsquo;s published journal which became a de facto guidebook for the region.</p>
                                <p>After nearly a month at Yuquot, Cook resumed his survey and renaming of the &nbsp;Northwest coast. They were in Prince William Sound by May, Cook Inlet in June and Ic(e)y Cape by August.</p>
                                <p>Cook was convinced the passage was at 71 degrees North, but ice prevented them sailing further.</p>
                                <p>The expedition returned to Hawai&rsquo;i in January 1779 for repairs and supplies.</p>
                                <p>Although they were welcomed back at first, a disagreement followed and Cook was killed by the Hawaiians on February 14th.</p>
                                <p>The crew continued their mission. On their way home, they learned that the sea-otter pelts they purchased in Yuquot could sell for a huge profit in China.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>A good pelt sold for $120&ndash; that&rsquo;s worth almost $3000 dollars today.</p>
                                <p>The sea otter story attracted a lot of interest among British navy sailors - many of them were on half pay after the American revolutionary war ended in 1783.</p>
                                <p>In 1785 the first British fur trading ship arrived at Yuquot.</p>
                                <p>The following summer, 7 British fur traders were in the area.</p>
                                <p>Fortunes were made.</p>
                                <p>In 1787 Captain Nathaniel Portlock and George Dixon, sold 2552 furs for $54,875 in Canton - that&rsquo;s worth about 1.4 million dollars today.</p>
                                <p>The Indigenous community&rsquo;s long-established trade networks quickly included British and American goods.&nbsp; A number of trade centers emerged among the coastal communities.</p>
                                <p>Each chief&rsquo;s power and influence grew with their increased wealth.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Initially it was not a bad thing to begin with however as time has gone on we realized perhaps it did not turn out quite so well for First Nations people.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Chief Michael Maquinna.</p>
                                <p>In 1788, financed by a conglomerate of British and Asian trading companies, John Meares, a former Royal Navy Lieutenant, arrived in Yuquot.</p>
                                <p>He built a schooner there and claimed he bought land from the Mowachaht Chief Maquinna to build a trading post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>By the spring of 1789 several American and British fur-traders were anchored in Yuquot.</p>
                                <p>Spain was increasingly concerned about its sovereignty claims over the region.</p>
                                <p>In addition to the growing British presence, they were monitoring Russia&rsquo;s fur-trading activities in the Aleutian Islands.</p>
                                <p>An expedition there in 1788 reported that the Russians had expanded their network significantly - 6 new trading posts and a large settlement on Kodiac island.</p>
                                <p>In May 1789, two Spanish frigates arrived in Yuquot commanded by Captain Esteban Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;nez.</p>
                                <p>They officially took possession of the cove and built a gun battery at the harbor entrance.</p>
                                <p>Later, the Argonaut fur trader arrived in July with Chinese laborer&rsquo;s and supplies for John Meare&rsquo;s trading post.</p>
                                <p>An argument erupted between Mart&iacute;nez and the ship&rsquo;s Captain, James Colnett.</p>
                                <p>Accusing the British fur traders of trespassing on Spanish territory, Mart&iacute;nez seized the ships, and arrested the crew.</p>
                                <p>In the midst of the skirmish, Chief Callicum, the brother &ndash;in-law of Chief Maquinna - was killed by the Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>John Meares returned to England from China in April 1790 with news of the injustices his trading company had suffered and asking for government help.</p>
                                <p>How would the British respond to these offences?</p>
