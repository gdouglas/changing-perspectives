                        <p>Brass <strong>sextant</strong> with five eyepieces, made by Jesse Ramsden, was used by Joseph Baker, Vancouver&rsquo;s First Lieutenant and is on loan courtesy of Richard Baker. The sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument with a graduated arc of 60Â° and a sighting mechanism, used for measuring the angular distances between objects and especially for taking altitudes in navigation.</p>

                        <p>A marine chronometer is a timepiece that is precise and accurate enough to be used as a portable time standard, meaning it can be used to determine longitude by accurately measuring the time of a known fixed location. When first developed in the 18th century, it was a major technical achievement, as accurate knowledge of the time during sea voyage is necessary for navigation without the use of electronic or communication devices.</p>
