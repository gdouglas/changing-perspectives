<p>(As the video begins, there is pensive music. On-screen text appears: Life on Board.)</p>
<p>(A journal entry appears in cursive on weathered paper.)</p>
<p>A narrator reads out a journal entry: &ldquo;On the 15th of December, 1790, I had the honour of receiving my commission as commander of His Majesty's sloop the Discovery, then lying at Deptford, where the next morning, I joined her, and began entering men&rdquo; Captain George Vancouver. </p>
<p>(A statue of Captain Vancouver is seen in front of the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s City Hall.)</p>
<p>Narrator: As Master and Commander of the expedition, Vancouver chose his crew, but was obliged to sign on a number of trainee officers, who had connections with politicians and senior ranks in the navy. As he did with Captain Cook, Sir Joseph Banks sponsored the expedition&rsquo;s scientific research on behalf of the Royal Society. </p>
<p>(A painting of Sir Joseph Banks is shown.)</p>
<p>Narrator: He required that Vancouver include the botanist and surgeon Archibald Menzies in the ship&rsquo;s company to collect and catalogue plants, as well as record his impressions of the Indigenous people they met.</p>
<p>(A painting of a middle-aged Menzies is shown, as well as some of his sketches of fauna and Indigenous communities.) </p>
<p>Narrator: The crew were mostly volunteers, but some may have been forced into service by press gangs that would search for men in the taverns and prisons. </p>
<p>(A historical painting of press gangs. There are men wielding swords and batons, threatening men in the street by a port.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Because volunteer crew were paid more, &ldquo;pressed&rdquo; men usually agreed to accept their fate and become volunteers as well. </p>
<p>(A series of paintings of seamen feeding pigs, cleaning out pigsty, and mopping the deck. An officer sits on a cannon directing orders to the volunteers.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The crew also had the prospect of winning a share of the prize money, 20,000 pounds for finding the Northwest Passage &ndash; over 4 million dollars in today&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>(A painting of men sleeping in hammocks and eating in the mess.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Living conditions were very cramped on board both the Discovery and the Chatham. On the Discovery, eighty seamen, junior officers and marines ate and socialized on the mess deck. They also slung their hammocks here to sleep. </p>
<p>(Infographic showing the different crew roles and corresponding numbers.) </p>
<p>Narrator: The senior officers, Archibald Menzies, and Captain Vancouver had their own cabins. Fresh meat, milk, and eggs from the animals on board were mainly for the officers. The crew ate salted meat, biscuits, and cheese washed down with homemade beer, and a daily ration of rum in the afternoon. </p>
<p>(A sketch of the inside of the galley and another of twenty men round a table on the mess deck with beer mugs in their hands. Around them are two cannons, and many sacks of food hanging from the ceiling.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Scurvy, a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet, could disable enough crew in just a few months to make it impossible to sail the vessel. </p>
<p>(A sketch of a man displaying scurvy symptoms, including lost teeth and sunken eyes. More sketches of bruised legs, with bumps, and prominent blue veins.)</p>
<p>Narrator: What caused scurvy was unknown at the time; however, the preventative measures first introduced by Captain Cook and later followed by Vancouver were successful. The cures included drinking concentrated citrus juice, eating sauerkraut, and regularly smoking out the lower decks by burning a combination of vinegar and gunpowder.</p>
<p>(A drawing of the scurvy preventative food and the lower deck being smoked out by crew members.) </p>
<p>Narrator: At sea, Royal Navy sailing vessels followed a strict routine. The crew were divided into watches. Each watch would take their turn manning the helm, navigating, setting sails, and keeping a lookout. Other duties included swabbing and scrubbing the decks, gunnery practice, and ship repairs. </p>
<p>(Re-enactment video of seamen manning the sails, pulling ropes, and firing cannons. Sound of cannon firing.)</p>
<p>Narrator: In order to explore the narrow inlets and channels when mapping the Northwest Coast, Vancouver would establish an observatory on shore and then send the crew off to survey in small rowboats with provisions for ten or more days. The crew covered more than 10,000 miles this way over the three summers it took to complete the work.</p>

<p>Narrator: Was Vancouver a good master and commander? Order and discipline were very important in safely running a ship. It was more important that the captain be respected and obeyed than popular with his crew. Corporal punishment was common in the Royal Navy. </p>
<p>(A series of drawings showing a sailor being flogged with a cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails whip, and a sailor in shackles. Sound of a whip striking a sailor.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Vancouver also had a reputation for being short-tempered and irritable which could be due in part to his poor health. He suffered from diseases he contracted while serving in the Caribbean. At least sixty of the Discovery&rsquo;s crew of one hundred men were flogged with the cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails, some regularly. Unusual for a trainee officer, Thomas Pitt was flogged a number of times. The young midshipman was a cousin of Prime Minister William Pitt, and the son of Baron Camelford. </p>
<p>(A drawing of a young Thomas Pitt in a top hat, coat, and holding a monocle.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Nonetheless, because of his violent temper and intolerance for authority, Vancouver finally sent Pitt home early aboard the expedition&rsquo;s supply ship in 1793. What was most important is that Vancouver maintained command of the expedition, accomplished his mission, and returned to England safely. </p>
<p>(An animated map depicts Captain Vancouver&rsquo;s route back to England.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Vancouver&rsquo;s relationship with Archibald Menzies was also often strained. A furious argument erupted during the expedition&rsquo;s return journey to Britain. A number of botanical specimens were lost in a storm. Menzies held Vancouver responsible and consequently refused to surrender his scientific journals for the official expedition publication. Vancouver had Menzies arrested on a charge of mutiny. Although the charges were eventually dropped, Menzies&rsquo; benefactor, Sir Joseph Banks, arranged to have Menzies&rsquo; journals published separately.</p>
<p>(Images of Menzies original handwritten journal are shown along with his portrait. Animation of jail doors closing. Sound of doors clanking.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Vancouver&rsquo;s troubles did not end there. Waiting for his return home, Vancouver found a letter from former midshipman Pitt challenging him to a duel. Pitt had recently inherited the family fortune and title. Now as the 2nd Baron Camelford, he was determined to use his influence as the prime minister&rsquo;s cousin to have his revenge and ruin his former commander&rsquo;s reputation. Vancouver refused to fight. Mysteriously, the admiralty delayed paying the Captain his expenses, and over four years backpay. Months later, Vancouver and his brother Charles were attacked by Camelford on a London street. A cartoon, an account of the street fight, was published in the press depicting Vancouver as cowardly for refusing to duel. </p>
<p>(A close-up of the historic political cartoon is shown. Vancouver&rsquo;s brother tries to separate Captain Vancouver and Lord Camelford. On the left, the taller Lord Camelford raises a weapon and shouts for Captain Vancouver to fight. The shorter, stouter Captain Vancouver on the right staggers back.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Hounded by the press and seriously in debt, Vancouver became a laughing stock. While his debts were eventually settled, his reputation among his fellow naval officers never recovered, despite the expedition&rsquo;s achievements. Vancouver died in May 1798. He was forty years old. His journal was published four months later. </p>
<p>(The statue of Captain Vancouver is seen again in front of the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s City Hall.)</p>
