                    <p>Small glass beads, like these, were valuable on the Pacific Northwest Coast in the late 1700s. Captain Vancouver's crew brought beads to trade with Indigenous peoples in exchange for sea otter pelts and for food. Indigenous communities viewed glass beads as a symbol of wealth. They used them to decorate clothing, replacing traditional shell, stone, and bone beads. Beading continues to be an important Indigenous artform. </p>

                    <p>Overseas fur-traders brought many iron goods on their ships in the 1700s, such as axes, pots, hammers, and knives. They traded these iron goods for otter pelts and food from the Indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples used these iron tools for hunting and cooking. </p>

                <p>This 1871 musket is a later model of those exchanged by fur traders for pelts in the late 1700s. Traditional Indigenous bows, arrows and clubs were often better weapons. These muskets were breakable, took a long time to reload, and were not accurate. However, muskets became a symbol of wealth on the coast, often gifted at potlatch feasts. </p>
                <p>Captain Vancouver did not allow the trading of muskets because he feared they would be used against his crew. His fear was heightened after several violent encounters: KƒÅnaka maoli killed one crewman at O'ahu in 1792 and Tlingit warriors attacked the expedition the following year. Two of the crew were wounded and as many as 9 Tlingit warriors were killed. British Royal Navy expeditions were usually heavily armed with handguns and cannons. Captain Vancouver tried to intimidate his hosts with fireworks and heavily armed ships.</p>
