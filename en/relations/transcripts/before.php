    (The video begins with a raven perched in a tree, making a croaking noise as
    well as a sound like water dripping. The video pans out to an overview shot
    of a river with forested hills. Drumming music is plays in the
    background.)<br />
    A Narrator says: Indigenous peoples have lived on the Pacific Northwest
    Coast since time immemorial. When the Europeans first came here, they
    encountered one of the most densely populated regions in North America.<br />
    (A map of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America indicates some First
    Nations territories.)<br />
    Narrator: Thousands of villages were located along the coast.<br />
    (Sounds of birds chirping and video of hundreds of birds flying above the
    ocean.)<br />
    (Overhead video of orcas swimming.)<br />
    Narrator: These Indigenous communities thrived in this vast and abundant
    region through their stewardship of the land and water.<br />
    Narrator: Salmon and other sea life were harvested annually.<br />
    (Underwater video of herring spawning.)<br />
    Narrator: Sophisticated economic systems, such as cultivating clam gardens,
    nurturing camas crops, fish trapping, and reef net fishing, allowed
    Indigenous peoples to live in their territories sustainably.<br />
    (Indigenous people gathering crops and boarding a canoe.)<br />
    Narrator: Their ecological knowledge emerged over millennium. It is shared
    across generations and is continually tested and improved.<br />
    (Video of Indigenous people paddling a canoe and of children learning to
    dance.)<br />
    Narrator: Red cedar bark, wood, roots, and leaves were used to construct big
    houses and canoes, in carving, weaving, and in sacred practices.<br />
    (Drone video over a Big House entrance and of dancers inside.) <br />
    Narrator: Indigenous communities maintained sophisticated legal traditions
    and practices that governed their relationship to the land. Diplomatic
    networks that centre on protocols of ceremony, trade, and intermarriage
    alliances connect communities together within and across the Indigenous
    Pacific Northwest. <br />

    in the forest. Image of Potlatch ceremony inside a long house. There is a
    large fire in the middle, and around stands community members in
    regalia.)<br />
    Narrator: It is particularly the Potlatch system that works to redistribute
    abundance within and between communities.<br />
    (Video of children, then of a Potlatch ceremony with singing in the
    background.) <br />
    Narrator: While warfare was not unknown, societies managed, for the most
    part, to balance the rights of individuals and groups as well as the rights
    of humans with other life forms.<br />
    (Video of Potlatch dancers wearing masks.)<br />
    Narrator: These governance, social, and economic systems still remain
    central to the prosperity of Indigenous nationhood today.<br />
