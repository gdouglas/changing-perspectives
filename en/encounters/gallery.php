                    <p>These 1892 photos from Alaska show how large sea otter pelts are. They have a soft, thick coat of fur to keep them warm in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples on the coast have hunted sea otters for food and fur for thousands of years. They traded the pelts with overseas fur traders starting in the 1700s. Sailors found the pelts beautiful and rare, and could sell them in China for a small fortune. Within 200 years, sea otters were almost hunted to extinction on the coast.</p>

                <p>Nuu-chah-nulth designed this hook to catch halibut, a large flatfish that swims along the ocean floor. The hook is bent from wood. It is 12.5cm long and 12.5cm wide.  A piece of bait would be tied onto the bone barb. Then the hook would be lowered down into the water on a rope.</p>
                <p>Captain Vancouver's crew were often hungry because they didn't know how to hunt and fish on the Pacific Northwest Coast. They traded for Indigenous fishing gear, but also relied on Indigenous communities for food and fresh water. This fish hook was collected by the surgeon's mate on the HMS Discovery, George Goodman Hewett, from the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation at Nootka Sound. </p>
