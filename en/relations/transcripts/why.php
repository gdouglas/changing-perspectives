<p>(As the video begins, there is pensive music. On-screen text appears: A Northwest Passage.)</p>
<p>A narrator reads out a journal entry: “There can be little doubt of there being a Northern communication of some sort, by sea, between this West side of America and the East side, through Baffin’s Bay.” Captain James Cook, Aleutian Islands, October 1778.</p>
<p>(The journal entry appears in cursive, overtop a drawing of a ship.)</p>
<p>The Narrator says: Britain was challenging Spain’s claim to sovereignty over the region in their attempts to find the Northwest Passage. As early as 1592, Juan de Fuca, a great mariner employed by Spain, believed he had found a route here.</p>
<p>(A historical cartographic map is displayed. It has a very detailed Asia, but North America is roughly outlined with few details. The map shows where Juan de Fuca sailed around the 49th parallel).</p>
<p>Narrator: There were also stories of a possible route found by the Spanish admiral, Bartholomew de Fonte, in this location, in 1640.</p>
<p>(On the same cartographic map, another route is shown at about 53° north.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The Hudson’s Bay Company employed Samuel Hearne and Matonabbee, a Dene guide, to explore overland routes. They reached the Arctic Ocean, at the mouth of the Coppermine River in 1771.</p>
<p>(An animated map shows a circuitous route Samuel Hearne and Matonabbee took leaving from Fort Prince of Wales on the west side of the Hudson’s Bay and back. After, a second route is shown leaving from Fort Prince of Wales north to the Arctic Ocean, and then back to Hudson’s Bay.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Around the same time, maps showing Russian discoveries gave rise to the idea of a clearwater passage to the north and east, across the top of America. Could a passage be this far north?</p>
<p>(On the same cartographic map, a route is drawn north between Russia and what is now Alaska into the Arctic Ocean.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The British speculated it was likely, and commissioned Captain James Cook to investigate. In January 1778, the expedition reached Hawai’i.</p>
<p>(An animated map of the world shows Captain Cook’s route from New Zealand north to Hawai’i (known as the Sandwich Islands by the British at that time).)</p>
<p>Narrator: They were the first Europeans to visit and map the archipelago.</p>
<p>(A drawing of the ships off Hawai’i and some cartographic maps drawn on that voyage are shown.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Cook was welcomed by hundreds of islanders as an honoured guest.</p>
<p>(A black and white drawing of Hawai’ians rowing to Captain Cook’s ship with the Hawai’ian mountains in the background.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Some believe the Hawai’ians thought that Cook was an incarnation of the Polynesian god Lono.</p>
<p>(A drawing of Captain Cook and some of his crew in Hawai’i surrounded by Hawai’ians sitting around.)</p>
<p>Narrator: By March, the expedition was approaching the Northwest Coast. They were thwarted by storms.</p>
<p>(An animated map shows Captain Cook's route from Hawai’i across the Pacific Ocean to the Northwest Coast of North America.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Consequently, they missed Juan de Fuca’s Strait, and were too far offshore to look for Admiral Fonte’s Passage. Cook’s journal shows he was skeptical about both these routes.</p>
<p>The narrator reads out a journal entry: “for my own part, I give no credit to such vague and improbable stories.” Captain James Cook, May 1778.</p>
<p>(Behind the cursive journal quote, a map of the Northwest Coast depicts Cook’s zagged route along the coast.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The ships anchored near the village of Yuquot. Cook mistakenly named the village Nootka, having misinterpreted the Mowachaht people when he arrived.</p>
<p>The narrator reads out a journal entry: “They would paddle…round both ships. A chief or other principal person standing up with a spear…they would come alongside and begin to trade without further ceremony…their articles were the skins of animals, in particular the Sea Beaver [Otter]...” Captain James Cook, April 1778, Ship Cove.</p>
<p>(Behind the cursive journal quote is a sketch of a sea otter from Captain Cook’s voyage.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The sailors traded with the Mowachaht people for supplies of wood, water, oil, fish, and furs, in exchange for mainly metal objects, a rare material in Yuquot.</p>
<p>(A series of sketches and paintings of Captain Cook’s ships anchored in Yuquot, with forested mountains and Mowachaht canoes around.)</p>
<p>Narrator: During their stay, John Webber and other ship artists made detailed drawings documenting life in the community. These would later appear as engravings in the expedition’s published journal, which became a defacto guidebook in the region.</p>
<p>(A series of sketches by John Webber and others of Mowachaht regalia and villages.)</p>
<p>Narrator: After nearly a month a Yuquot, Cook resumed his survey and renaming of the Northwest Coast. They were in Prince William Sound by May, Cook Inlet in June, and Icy Cape by August.</p>
<p>(The cartographic map of the Northwest Coast shows Cook’s route along the coast. Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet are both on the southern side of Alaska, whereas Icy Cape is in the Arctic at 70 degrees North.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Cook was convinced the Passage was at 71 degrees North, but ice prevented them sailing further. The expedition returned to Hawai’i in January 1779 for repairs and supplies. Although they were welcomed back at first, a disagreement followed, and Cook was killed by the Hawai’ians on February 14th.</p>
<p>(A painting of the battle between Cook’s crew and the Hawai’ians. Gunshots are heard in the background.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The crew continued their mission. On their way home, they learned that the sea otter pelts they purchased in Yuquot could sell for a huge profit in China. A good pelt sold for $120. That’s worth almost $3,000 today.</p>
<p>(An animated map shows that the crew sailed from Hawai’i up north along the coast of Asia, then south to China.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The sea otter story attracted a lot of interest among British Navy sailors. Many of them were on half-pay after the American Revolutionary War ended in 1783. In 1785, the first British fur trading ship arrived in Yuquot. The following summer, seven British fur traders were in the area. Fortunes were made.</p>
<p>(A map shows Yuquot on a large island on the Pacific Northwest Coast, at about 49 degrees North.)</p>
<p>Narrator: In 1787, Captain Nathaniel Portlock and George Dixon sold 2,552 furs for $54,875 in Canton. That’s worth about $1.4 million today. The Indigenous communities’ long-established trade networks quickly included British and American goods. A number of trade-centres emerged among the coastal communities.</p>
<p>(On a map of the Pacific Northwest Coast, the nearby trade centres of Yuquot and Clayoquot Sound are highlighted. Further north around 55 degrees North, the trade centres of Kiusta and Kaigani on large islands are highlighted.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Each chief’s power and influence grew with their increased wealth.</p>
<p>(Chief Michael Maquinna of Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation is interviewed on screen, with an enlarged sketch behind of an ancestral village.)</p>
<p>Chief Michael Maquinna: “Initially, it was not a bad thing to begin with. However, as time had gone on, we realized that perhaps it didn’t turn out so well for First Nation people.”</p>
<p>Narrator: In 1788, financed by a conglomerate of British and Asian trading companies, John Meares, a former Royal Navy lieutenant, arrived in Yuquot. He built a schooner there and claimed he bought land from the Mowachaht Chief Maquinna to build a trading post.</p>
<p>(A painting of a schooner being built on the coast is shown, overlaid by two separate drawings of Chief Maquinna in a woven regalia hat and John Meares.)</p>
<p>Narrator: By the spring of 1789, several American and British fur traders were anchored in Yuquot. Spain was increasingly concerned about its sovereignty claims over the region. In addition to the growing British presence, they were monitoring Russia’s fur trading activities in the Aleutian Islands. An expedition there in 1788 reported that the Russians had expanded their networks significantly. Six new trading posts and a large settlement on Kodiak Island.</p>
<p>(A map shows the Aleutian Islands on the southern part of what is now Alaska and Kodiak Island to the east.)</p>
<p>Narrator: In May, 1789, two Spanish frigates arrived in Yuquot commanded by Captain Esteban José Martínez. They officially took possession of the Cove and built a gun battery at the harbour entrance.</p>
<p>(A drawing shows a trading post with a flag in the Cove.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Later, the Argonaut fur trader arrived in July with Chinese labourers and supplies for John Meares trading post. An argument erupted between Martínez and the ship’s captain, James Colnett. Accusing the British fur traders of trespassing on Spanish territory, Martínez seized the ships and arrested the crew. In the midst of the skirmish, Chief Callicum, the brother-in-law of Chief Maquinna, was killed by the Spanish. John Meares returned to England from China in April, 1790, with news of the injustices his trading company had suffered and asking for government help.</p>
<p>How would the British respond to these offences?</p>
