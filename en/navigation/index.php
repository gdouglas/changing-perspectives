                                <p>How did Captain Vancouver navigate the oceans?</p>
                                <p>Well, he relied on a magnetic compass to know which direction the ship was sailing.</p>
                                <p>While the navigator knew the ship&rsquo;s general direction, the problem was figuring out how far the ship had travelled once he had lost sight of the land.</p>
                                <p>North or south was easy to determine using latitude; a method developed by Arabian Navigators in the 9th century.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>They applied imaginary lines around the earth east to west, and numbered them from zero degrees at the equator to 90 degrees at each of the poles.</p>
                                <p>Explorers would then use math rules relating to triangles called trigonometry to measure the angle between the horizon and the North Star.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;The North Star- also called Polaris- is the perfect point to measure from because it barely changes its position &ndash; and is conveniently located right above the North Pole.</p>
                                <p>With an instrument called a sextant, the sailing crew could measure the angle, and if it said, say, 50 degrees, that would mean their ship is located at 50 degrees south of the North Pole. 90 degrees minus 50 degrees equals 40 degrees. So the ship is located at latitude 40 degrees north of the equator.</p>
                                <p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
                                <p>Using this method, the crew could know exactly how far they&rsquo;ve travelled north or south, and keep perfectly positioned until they spotted land again.</p>
                                <p>However, figuring out how far east or west the ship had travelled remained a big problem.</p>
                                <p>To solve this, Captain Vancouver was able to use an innovative new method that had just been perfected by his predecessor, Captain Cook.</p>
                                <p>The solution relied on the regular rotation of the earth in relation to the sun, and a very accurate clock.</p>
                                <p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
                                <p>We know that the earth rotates from east to west 360 degrees every 24 hours.</p>
                                <p>Just do the math, and 360 divides by 24 to make, 15. So, in one hour the earth moves 15 degrees relative to the sun.</p>
                                <p>Still with me?</p>
                                <p>Just like latitude, degrees of longitude were established to mark new imaginary lines around the earth, but these lines run north to south.</p>
                                <p>And because the British thought this idea up, they decided that the zero degrees longitude line - or the Prime Meridian - should run right through the Greenwich observatory, located in London England.</p>
                                <p>If you have an accurate clock on board your ship and set it to the time at Greenwich &ndash; Greenwich Mean Time - you can then compare Greenwich time against the ship&rsquo;s local time to determine how far you are east or west of Greenwich.</p>
                                <p>Here&rsquo;s an example, First the navigator has to determine the local noon time where the ship is located. He does this with a sextant to measure when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. If at 12 noon local time our clock shows Greenwich Mean Time is 4 in the afternoon, then we can calculate that we are 4 hours behind Greenwich time.</p>
                                <p>Knowing that one hour is 15 degrees - we must be 4 hours times 15 degrees behind Greenwich, So, 60 degrees west of England.&nbsp; Simple, Right?</p>
                                <p>While this method of determining longitude was fairly easy to understand, it still required a super reliable clock in order to do it. And a clock accurate enough for the job did not exist.</p>
                                <p>In 1714 the British government offered a prize of 20,000 pounds to anyone who could pull this off. That&rsquo;s about $4 Million today!</p>
                                <p>Well, in 1761 a clockmaker named John Harrison finally did it with his invention of the marine chronometer.</p>
                                <p>Captain James Cook gave Harrison&rsquo;s chronometer its first long run test by using it on his second and third voyages exploring the Pacific Ocean over a number of years.</p>
                                <p>Cook was delighted with it.</p>
                                <p>Because explorers could now easily determine their exact location in terms of both latitude and longitude, it became possible for Cook and then later Captain Vancouver, to draw very accurate maps.</p>
                                <p>Previous attempts to create a map without knowing a ships exact location was essentially guess work. Look at this early Russian map of the Northwest coast, and now compare it to this one here created by Captain Vancouver.</p>
                                <p>Landmarks and ocean depths along the coast line could be recorded in more detail than ever before by marking exact positions of longitude x and latitude Y</p>
                                <p>And that&rsquo;s how Captain Vancouver navigated the oceans hundreds of years ago!</p>

                                <p>What were the vessels like that Captain Vancouver sailed in?</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;A European ship in the 1700&rsquo;s was made from a variety of different wood.</p>
                                <p>The frame of the vessel was made from White Oak, because of its strength and resistance to rotting.</p>
                                <p>The decks and hull planking were made from Cedar or Fir.</p>
                                <p>And Sitka Spruce was preferred for the masts and spars as they could more easily bend without breaking in heavy winds.</p>
                                <p>A mast would be &ldquo;stepped&rdquo; into the keel and then secured in place by shrouds and stays made from tar covered hemp rope.</p>
                                <p>Vessels like this needed a lot of looking after, so crew included a number of carpenters.</p>
                                <p>Masts and spars would frequently need to be replaced.</p>
                                <p>Leaks were a constant concern.</p>
                                <p>In Vancouver&rsquo;s time the vessel&rsquo;s bottom was also sheathed in copper to protect it against Teredo worm which is a saltwater clam that burrows into the timber.</p>
                                <p>The copper bottom also helped a ship to slip faster through the water.</p>
                                <p>European vessels were powered by the wind using a combination of four sided &ldquo;square&rdquo; sails and triangular &ldquo;Lateen&rdquo; sails made from canvas.</p>
                                <p>The design of these vessels evolved from Venetian, Roman and Viking boats that originally sailed along the European coastline.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>By the 16th century, bigger vessels with enclosed decks were developed to cross the ocean.&nbsp; Square sails were more commonly used for long ocean crossings because they captured more wind.</p>
                                <p>On the downside, a square-rigged ship ideally needed to have the wind coming from behind or beside it.</p>
                                <p>Because sailors had to go aloft to change the sails, which means climbing up the rigging, these vessels required large crews.</p>
                                <p>There was also a strong possibility of losing seaman from falling off the rigging and going overboard. Sadly, it was not always possible to go back and find them.</p>
                                <p>Captain Vancouver had two vessels for his expedition, His Majesty&rsquo;s Ship Discovery (HMS Discovery for short) and HMS Chatham.</p>
                                <p>Both vessels were ideal for survey work; they had shallow drafts which meant they could get in close to shore.</p>
                                <p>They also had rounded nearly flat bottoms which meant they would be less likely to roll over if they did become grounded.</p>
                                <p>That&rsquo;s very handy when you sailing in unknown waters!</p>
                                <p>The Discovery was about 100 feet long and 28 feet across. It was very similar to Captain Cook&rsquo;s Ship &ndash; HMS Endeavour.</p>
                                <p>The design was based on a Collier - a ship that transports coal. Consequently, the hull was very strong and there was a large amount of space below deck.</p>
                                <p>The Chatham was half the size, 53 feet long and 22 feet across.</p>
                                <p>As a general rule, the bigger the sail area and the longer the vessel the faster it will go.</p>
                                <p>The Discovery, had a top speed of 8 nautical miles in one hour. That&rsquo;s about 15 Kilometers per hour.</p>
                                <p>The Chatham was a &ldquo;Brig&rsquo; which meant it was rigged mostly with square sails on two masts.</p>
                                <p>The Discovery was a &ldquo;Fully Rigged Ship&rdquo; which meant it was rigged mostly with square sails on three masts.</p>
                                <p>The British navy classified these vessels as &ldquo;Sloops of War&rdquo; which meant they had less than 20 large guns.</p>
                                <p>The Discovery had 10 guns and the Chatham had 4. By comparison, a first-rate British Navy warship from this period would have over 100 large guns and was roughly twice the size of Discovery.</p>
                                <p>The Discovery had a crew of 100 men which included 9 ship&rsquo;s officers, 38 able seamen to sail the ship, a military force of 16 marines, and skilled tradesmen such as carpenters, sailmakers, cooks, servants, gunners and a surgeon.</p>
                                <p>The Chatham had a crew of 45 in a similar combination of officers, seaman, marines and tradesmen. Life on board both vessels would have been very cramped.</p>
                                <p>Why are square sails uncommon today?</p>
                                <p>By the 1800&rsquo;s, multiple mast schooners were becoming popular particularly for trading and fishing vessels.</p>
                                <p>They employed a fore and aft rig.&nbsp; This meant that rather than having the sails positions across the ship using spars the sail ran along the length of the ship using booms.</p>
                                <p>Less crew was needed on a schooner because the sails could be changed on deck, no crew was needed to go aloft.</p>
                                <p>The fore and aft sails also allowed the vessel to sail closer to the wind, which means it could sail with the wind nearer to the bow of the ship.</p>
                                <p>This ultimately shortened the length of the journey.</p>
                                <p>Modern sailing yachts today still use a fore and aft sail rig. They also have metal masts and deeper keels which can support much larger sails.</p>
                                <p>Unlike vessels in Captain Vancouver&rsquo;s time, ships today usually have a lot fewer cannons</p>

                                <p>Setting foot on a sailing ship could leave you a little puzzled about what everyone is talking about. The orders a Captains gives the crew, even today, can almost sound like a different language.</p>
                                <p>See If you can learn a few words and phrases. It will go a long way in helping you understand how sailing a ship works.&nbsp; Maybe one day you&rsquo;ll get to join the crew!</p>
                                <p>Let's start here, on this square rigged Brig very similar to one used by Captain Vancouver hundreds of years ago.</p>
                                <p>All boats have a bow, stern, port and starboard sides. The sails are attached to masts and yards and are identified by their position on the boat (fore and main), and their position on the mast (top sails and top gallant sails).&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>A captain might call, <em>"Hand aloft to loose out the fore and main tops'ls and t'gallants."</em></p>
                                <p>Hand refers to crew.</p>
                                <p>Aloft, well, that means climb on up the rigging.</p>
                                <p>Tops'ls and T'gallants is a bit of nautical slang for Top Sails and Top Gallant Sails.</p>
                                <p>So, "Hand aloft to loose out the fore and main tops'ls and t'gallants," is the Captain&rsquo;s order for the crew to climb up the fore and main masts, and let down the top and top gallant sails.</p>
                                <p><em>&ldquo;Let fall!&rdquo;</em></p>

                                <p>Once the sails are 'loosed', most of the work sailing the ship happens down on the decking<br />using ropes. Ropes used to maneuver the sails are called halyards and braces, depending on<br />what they are attached to.<br />The captain may now call, "Hands to halyard. Haul away Halyard!&rdquo;<br />And the crew would go about pulling those halyard ropes to hoist up the yard, which is the<br />horizontal pole above the sail.<br />Those sails need to be good and tight to get the most out of the wind.<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well halyard!&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>Now that the sails are up, the Captain can steer the ship using the rudder and the wind. Something he calls tacking.</p>
                                <p>He uses the Helm which moves the rudder at the stern. And that moves the boat left or right.</p>
                                <p>At the same time the captain orders the crew to move the sails to make sure they catch the wind</p>
                                <p>The Captain shouts:</p>
                                <p><em>"Hands to main braces. Brace up sharp, port tack."</em></p>
                                <p>Braces are ropes attached to the yard. They are used for rotating the yard around the mast. "Brace up sharp, port tack" means to rotate hard towards the wind, which happens to be coming from the port side.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>And from there, you can determine the full command given by the captain. If you were talking to your friend you might say, "Hey buddy, grab that rope attached to the spinny part of that horizontal pole there, about halfway up, and pull it hard until it's facing the left and catching that wind." But, that's a mouthful!</p>

                        <p>A marine chronometer is a timepiece that is precise and accurate enough to be used as a portable time standard, meaning it can be used to determine longitude by accurately measuring the time of a known fixed location. When first developed in the 18th century, it was a major technical achievement, as accurate knowledge of the time during sea voyage is necessary for navigation without the use of electronic or communication devices.</p>
