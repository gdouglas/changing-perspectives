<p>Narrator: Setting foot on a sailing ship could leave you a little puzzled about what everyone is talking about. The orders a Captain gives the crew, even today, can almost sound like a different language. See If you can learn a few words and phrases. It will go a long way in helping you understand how sailing a ship works. Maybe one day you’ll get to join the crew!</p>

<p>Let’s start here, on this square-rigged brig very similar to the one used by Captain Vancouver hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>(The brig is on the water. It has two masts, each with two square sails. At the front of the ship are two triangular sails. The back of the ship has a large sail.)</p>
<p>All boats have a bow, stern, port and starboard sides. The sails are attached to masts and yards and are identified by their position on the boat (fore and main), and their position on the mast (top sails and top gallant sails).</p>
<p>(The front of the ship is labelled “bow”. The back of the ship is labelled “stern”. The left side of the ship is labelled “port” and the right side is labelled “starboard”. Masts are the tall, vertical posts with which sails are attached. The yards are long, horizontal beams that support the top and bottom of the sails. The foresails are sails closest to the bow and the mainsails are in the centre of the ship. The topsails are high on the masts, the topgallant sails are the sails at the top of the masts.)</p>
<p>Narrator: A captain might call,</p>
<p>Captain: “Hands aloft to loose out the fore and main tops’ls and t’gallants.”</p>
<p>Narrator: Hands refers to crew. Aloft, well, that means climb on up the rigging.</p>
<p>(Video of sailors climbing up the rope ladders, known as rigging, all the way to the top of the masts.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Tops’ls and T’gallants is a bit of nautical slang for Top Sails and Top Gallant Sails. So, “Hand aloft to loose out the fore and main tops’ls and t’gallants,” is the Captain’s order for the crew to climb up the fore and main masts, and let down the top and topgallant sails.</p>
<p>Captain: “Let fall!”</p>
<p>(The sailors then walk out on horizontal ropes to roll down the topsails and topgallant sails, opening up the white sails.)</p>
