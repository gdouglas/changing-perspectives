<p>(As the video begins, there is upbeat Celtic music with violin. Video of a 1700s brig sailing at sea on a sunny day. The video focuses on the highest sails on the ship. The white sails are unrolling, opening up.) Narrator: Once the sails are 'loosed', most of the work sailing the ship happens down on the decking using ropes.</p>
<p>(Sailors are pulling at some of the many ropes on the deck and attached to masts on the ship.)</p>
<p>Narrator: Ropes used to maneuver the sails are called halyards and braces, depending on what they are attached to.</p>
<p>(Halyards and braces are long ropes extending from the deck up to the sails. Halyards are used to hoist sails and ladders. Braces are used to rotate sails to a different angle.)</p>
<p>Narrator: The captain may now call,</p>
<p>Captain: &quot;Hands to halyard. Haul away Halyard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Narrator: And the crew would go about pulling those halyard ropes to hoist up the yard, which is the horizontal pole above the sail. Those sails need to be good and tight to get the most out of the wind.</p>
<p>(Five sailors on deck are seen pulling hard on a rope that lifts the yard, thereby raising up a sail high above the crew.)</p>
<p>Captain: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well halyard!&rdquo;</p>
