    European Global Trade)<br />
    A narrator reads out a journal entry: &ldquo;The evening of April the 29th
    brought us to an anchor in very thick rainy weather, about eight miles
    within the entrance on the southern shore of the supposed Straits of De
    Fuca. The following morning&#8230;a gentle breeze sprang up from the North
    West&#8230;which presented to our view this renowned inlet.&rdquo; End of
    journal entry. <br />
    (The journal entry appears in cursive, overtop a painting of a ship.)<br />
    Narrator: Captain Vancouver came to the Pacific North West Coast in 1792 to
    complete the last in a series of European expeditions. Why were the
    Europeans undertaking these journeys? To understand that, we need to wind
    the clock back 400 years. For centuries trade with Asia for spices and cloth
    had gone along the Silk Road. <br />
    (The route of the Silk Road is drawn on a map of Eurasia, from China, over
    the north of India, into Europe.)<br />
    Narrator: To increase their profits, the Europeans began looking for a sea
    route.<br />
    (Map of the world shows arrows extending from Europe into the Atlantic Ocean
    with question marks around them.)<br />
    Narrator: Christopher Columbus thought he had found it when he sailed west
    in 1492 &ndash; although unknowingly, he had only reached the Caribbean.
    Vasco da Gama did make it to Asia when he sailed east around Africa to reach
    India in 1498. These explorers were willing to trade with the people they
    encountered but took what they wanted by force if necessary. <br />
    (Historical drawings and paintings depict European explorers with flags and
    heavily-armed crew members meeting Indigenous peoples.)<br />
    Narrator: Pope Alexander VI gave the Portuguese and Spanish the &ldquo;God
    Given Right&rdquo; to claim ownership of the new lands. At the Treaty of
    Tordesillas in 1494, they agreed to divide the new world between themselves.
    Portugal would have all lands East of the Cape Verde Islands and Spain all
    lands to the West.<br />
    (There is a map of the world south of Spain and Portugal. A white line
    vertically divides the world at 46 degrees latitude, cutting through the
    Atlantic Ocean and what is now Brazil. To the right of this line, Africa,
    Indonesia, Brazil, and a majority of Antarctica are shaded in green to
    represent the Pope&rsquo;s 1494 declaration that these lands were claimed by
    Portugal. The southern USA, Central America, and the rest of South America
    and Antarctica are shaded in red for Spain.)<br />
    Narrator: With the Pope&rsquo;s blessing, the Spanish and Portuguese
    explorers saw themselves as bringing the Christian religion to the people
    they encountered, whether they wanted it or not.<br />
    (Historical paintings and drawings of Spanish and Portuguese armies battling
    Indigenous communities. There are sounds of gunshots.)<br />
    Narrator: In Central and South America, the Spanish conquistadores conspired
    with rival indigenous groups to overwhelm the Aztec and Incan civilizations.
    The Spanish plundered gold and silver from these communities estimated at 11
    billion dollars in today&rsquo;s money. The Portuguese and Spanish also
    established sugar plantations in Brazil and in the Caribbean. <br />
    (A map shows what is now Brazil in green, representing what land was claimed
    by Portugal. Western and southern USA, Central America, the Caribbean, and
    the rest of South America are in red to represent what was claimed by
    Spain.)<br />
    Narrator: They enslaved the Indigenous populations to work in these
    plantations and sold the sugar at a huge profit in Europe. <br />
    (Graphic historical drawings of Indigenous peoples being tortured and
    enslaved and performing hard labour on sugar plantations.)<br />
    Narrator: Once the Indigenous populations were decimated, they traded with
    African Coastal tribes for enslaved African men, women and children to
    provide the labour they needed.<br />
    (An animated map of the lands around the Atlantic Ocean. The map first
    focuses on the west coast of Africa. The map shows icons of people near
    Liberia and down in Angola. Cape Coast, Ghana is labelled as &ldquo;Gold
    Coast&rdquo;. Red and green slave ship routes are drawn from the Gold Coast,
    across the Atlantic Ocean, to Spain and Portugal&rsquo;s claimed lands in
    North and South America. Multiple historical drawings depicting the torture
    and living conditions on the slave ships are shown.)<br />
    Narrator: In the 17th century, Holland, Britain and France began to
    challenge Spain and Portugal&rsquo;s control over trade with the New World.
    The Dutch took over the spice trade in the East Indies. The British
    established plantations and colonies in the Caribbean and along the east
    coast of North America.
    <br />
    (A map of North America highlights Britain&rsquo;s land claims in purple.
    Belize, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the east coast of Nicaragua, the east coast of
    the USA, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the lands surrounding the
    Hudson&rsquo;s Bay are all highlighted purple.)<br />
    Narrator: In 1670 they established the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Fur Trading
    monopoly. France began trading in India, established plantations in the
    Caribbean, and the territory of New France with Quebec City at the
    centre.<br />
    (A map of North America highlights France&rsquo;s land claims in blue.
    French Guiana, St. Lucia, Haiti, Quebec, New Brunswick, and most of Ontario,
    Manitoba, and central USA down to New Orleans are all highlighted blue. Much
    of western Canada and the USA remains grey, un-highlighted, representing no
    European claims yet.)<br />
    Narrator: By 1730, the European trading networks had become truly global,
    concentrating on an Atlantic trading triangle. Enslaved people became the
    core source of profit for all the European powers.<br />
    (On-screen text appears. The words &ldquo;Manufactured goods&rdquo; are in a
    text box centred at the top of the screen. The words &ldquo;Plantation
    products&rdquo; are in a text box at the bottom left of the screen. The
    words &ldquo;Slaves&rdquo; are in a text box at the bottom right of the
    screen. Lines connect these text boxes, creating the shape of a triangle.
    The words disappear, replaced by a map of the lands around the Atlantic
    Ocean. An arrow from Africa to South and North America is labelled
    &ldquo;slaves&rdquo;. A second arrow from North America to Europe is
    labelled &ldquo;sugar, coffee, hides&rdquo;. A third arrow from Europe to
    Africa is labelled &ldquo;cloth, guns, cowries, rum&rdquo;. The arrows
    create a triangular shape, reminiscent of the connected textboxes
    previously.)<br />
    Narrator: By the 18th century over 6.5 million Africans had been captured
    and transported. Life expectancy on the plantations was low. In the sugar
    plantations of Saint-Domingue, 30,000 enslaved Africans arrived annually;
    half of them would die within 3 to 8 years.<br />
    (Historical drawings of crowded living conditions on plantations, the brutal
    punishment of slaves, and slaves working on plantations surrounded.)<br />
    Narrator: The European powers fought over each other&rsquo;s colonies in the
    7 Years' War &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first truly global conflict.<br />
    (Sounds of canons firing. Historical painting of large sailing ships
    battling at sea. One ship has all its masts and sails broken.)<br />
    Narrator: France lost Quebec City to the British in 1759 at the Battle of
    the Plains of Abraham. And consequently, gave up its North American
    territory to Britain and Spain in a peace treaty signed in Paris in 1763.<br />
    (A map of North America and Central America. All of Canada and the USA east
    of Saskatchewan is highlighted in purple, representing Britain. Central and
    southern USA, Mexico, and Central America are highlighted in red,
    representing Spain. The rest of North America remains grey,
    un-highlighted.)<br />
    Narrator: With their imperial dominance secure, the British commissioned the
    first of three expeditions to complete the mapping of the Pacific.<br />
    (A map of the world is shown. A white sailing route begins in Britain, sails
    south through the Atlantic Ocean, circumnavigating the southern hemisphere
    before returning north to Britain. The sailing route sails around New
    Zealand and along the east coast of Australia. This route is very jagged.
    This route represents Captain Cook&rsquo;s circumnavigation around the
    world.)<br />
    Narrator: And ideally find a faster sea route to Asia through North America
    &ndash; the Northwest Passage.<br />
    (On the same map, a number of routes appear across North America, dotted by
    question marks and the on-screen text &ldquo;The Northwest
    Passage&rdquo;.)<br />
    Narrator: The expedition was led by Captain James Cook, a skilled mapmaker
    and navigator. Over seven years and two expeditions, Cook drew the first
    maps of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. He also confirmed
    that, other than Antarctica, there were no other southern continents. <br />
    (A painting of Captain Cook shows him with grey hair, in a blue and white
    buttoned navy uniform, and holding a telescope and tricorn triangular hat.
    Overtop Captain Cook&rsquo;s white sailing route, a red sailing route is
    drawn to represent Cook&rsquo;s second voyage. The red route begins again in
    Britain, sails closer to Antarctica travelling east. It passes around New
    Zealand, and circles the Pacific Ocean a couple of times before returning to
    Britain.)<br />
    Narrator: In the age of colonial conquest, maps were an important source of
    wealth. Indigenous territories became unrecorded blank spaces which the
    Europeans would claim as their own.<br />
    (A map shows Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia highlighted
    in purple, representing that they were claimed by the British.)<br />
    Narrator: Cook&rsquo;s expeditions were sponsored by the Royal Society
    &ndash; a British Scientific Academy. In addition to maps, these expeditions
    returned with carefully documented information provided by scientists and
    artists about the people they met and the plants and animals they
    encountered.<br />
    (A book with the ornate Royal Society logo as the cover, opens to show
    drawings of animals, such as a penguin and kangaroo, of Indigenous peoples
    with face tattoos, and of fruit trees.)<br />
    Narrator: Official journals were published and widely read by the general
    public. Cook became a national hero. With mapping of the Southern Pacific
    complete, would Cook now complete his mission and return to find the
    Northwest Passage?
