Type written text quote on a beige background reads: &ldquo;We are the Mowachaht and Muchalaht First Nation, the people of Nootka Sound on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. This region has been the homeland of our ancestors since the beginning of time. .... We are here to share with you our understanding of our history and our culture and in particular Yuquot, our most important community&rdquo; Chief Ambrose Maquinna, Gold River 1997<br>
Narrator: Yuquot means &ldquo;where the winds blow from all directions.&rdquo; For us, Yuquot is the center of the world and the best place to be, between the abundance and energy of the ocean and the majesty and richness of the forest and inlets.<br>
(Short video snippets of Yuquot cove and the surrounding forested hills and beaches. A pan over a carved welcome post.)<br>
Narrator: It is a place of power and change. A place of many stories, including the story of the first Chief Maquinna meeting the Europeans when they arrived here in their &ldquo;Floating Houses&rdquo; over 200 years ago.<br>
(A drawing of Chief Maquinna from the late 1700s, wearing traditional regalia and a woven hat. A painting of the ship HMS Resolution.)<br>
Narrator: We were pleased with the trade &ndash; exchanging a few furs, for items we greatly valued, like iron and cloth. We were careful to make friends with all our visitors. Our skills in diplomacy and in barter earned Yuquot the name Friendly Cove.<br>
(Sketch of villagers trading with fur traders.)<br>
Narrator: The fur trade brought Yuquot to the center of Western history.<br>
(Painting of British and Spanish ships anchored at Yuquot.)<br>
Quote on screen: &ldquo;Many more ships began to arrive at Yuquot. This was a good time for us. We learned that they did not all come from the same nation, or speak the same language. We learned, too, that some of our visitors were good people, and others were scoundrels.&rdquo;<br>
(Hereditary Chief Michael Maquinna of Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation is interviewed on screen, with an enlarged sketch behind of their ancestral village.)<br>
Hereditary Chief Michael Maquinna: &ldquo;Initially it was not a bad thing to begin with however as time has gone on we realized perhaps it did not turn out quite so well for First Nations people.&rdquo;<br>
Narrator: As the sea otter became scarce the ships stopped coming to Yuquot. Although the fur traders left our territory, the disease they brought remained. The results were devastating.<br>
(Drumming and singing music in the background becomes louder and more forceful. A painting showing the fur trading ships switches to video of the now empty cove.)</p>

Chief Jerry Jack: Some tribes in our nation got wiped right out. There wasn&rsquo;t one survivor. Not one.<br>
Quote on screen: &ldquo;We know that we once numbered many tribes, counting among us several thousand...By the beginning of the 20th century we numbered fewer than 300&rdquo; Chief Ambrose Maquinna, Gold River 1997.<br>
Narrator: No one today can imagine what suffering this brought to the few of our people who survived.<br>

Quote on screen: &ldquo;Since those sad days we have lived through other indignities at the hands of the Canadian government: the loss of our territories, the loss of control of our own affairs, the loss of our children &ndash; our future - to residential schools&rdquo; Chief Ambrose Maquinna, Gold River 1997.<br>
(Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith is interviewed. He is elderly, with graying hair. He wears a Rodgers baseball cap and red plaid jacket. He sits by a large tree.)<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: And my name is Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomlth. That&rsquo;s my real name, and it means &ldquo;spirit of the wolf,&rdquo; and that name was taken away when I went to residential school.<br>
(Melancholy music. Photographs of residential school buildings.)<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: The Catholic Church gave me Catholic names, like Joseph Peter; that&rsquo;s why my name is Raymond Joseph Peter. Raymond was a given name, Joseph Peter was given to me by the Bishop without my parents&rsquo; consent, or without my parents&rsquo; permission. There was 12, 14 children here. They were taken away and put on a steam ship to go to residential school in Kakawis Tofino.<br>
(Series of black and white photographs of small boys pulling a rope by the beach, holding toddlers, and posing in school uniform for a class photo.)<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: And little did we know where we were going&#8230;We didn&rsquo;t know we were going to a jail.<br>
(Black and white image of residential school and church staff. Another photo of a priest with young residential school children.)<br>
Narrator: When the government took the children, it was a devastating emotional blow to everyone. The children could not learn their language, traditional skills and histories.<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: All the time we were there, it was work, work, work and hardly any school. It was mostly like building roads, packing up coal or wood for fire for the furnace.<br>
(Posed black and white photos of girls and boys at residential school.)<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: Us children were forced to do that kind of work, and it was really tough on us children. It was terrible! And we&rsquo;d get strapped for disobeying. Get strapped on our hands or on our bum. The children were, when they died, the parents weren&rsquo;t informed. They were buried at the school there, without the parents&rsquo; knowledge of how their children died or what they died from.<br>
Narrator: In 1917 the Nootka Packing Company established a cannery near Yuquot.<br>
(Black and white photograph of cannery buildings built on a pier with many fishing boats anchored along it. Photos of women workers with smocks and their hair tied up.)<br>
Narrator: Almost everyone worked there. While women worked in the cannery the men crewed on boats rented or bought with loans from the company.<br>
(Black and white photograph of eight fishing boats lined up by the cannery in the snow.)<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: We were doing really well, taking care of ourselves. Not getting rich, but actually living off the fishing industry. It was mostly just the First Nations people, Japanese and Chinese people. All the managers and bosses, they were all white people.<br>
(Black and white photos of women cannery workers, and white cannery owner.)<br>
Narrator: Canneries were once all along the BC coast. But, in order to increase their profits, the canning companies closed down the more remote canneries and built bigger ones in the cities.<br>
(Animated map of canneries along the BC coast. Over time, there are fewer and fewer canneries.)<br>
Narrator: The Nootka cannery closed in 1945. We tried to establish our own fishing cooperative.<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: And that was destroyed to nothing. Took away the fish camp, took away everything. And it really, really hurt us. That was our living. Like I said, not to get rich, but living, eh.<br>
Narrator: Rather than help to sustain our community, the government wanted to force us to leave Yuquot.<br>
Ghoo-Noom-Tuuk-Tomith: We had 26 trolling boats here. They torched them away; they took some on a beach, and burnt them with the RCMP there. Because our people were afraid; our people were totally afraid of Indian Affairs, and the Commissioner, and the RCMP.<br>
Narrator: The closing of Yuquot&rsquo;s elementary school was the last straw. It meant we had to send our children away to Residential school at an even younger age. Families began to leave.<br>
(Black and white photograph of a small one-story schoolhouse. Photo of a relative holding a young toddler.)<br>
Chief Michael Maquinna: I left Yuquot when I was a youth. I lived there till I was about four or five years old. The times I remember was quite extraordinary and very family-oriented, very healthy community. We were vibrant by way of having economics and certainly had a good livelihood with regards to some of our resources and particularly the fishing industry.<br>
(Series of black and white photographs of villagers smiling and posing for the camera.)<br>
Narrator: The government permitted logging companies to begin cutting down our old-growth forest in the 1930&rsquo;s.<br>
(Contemporary image of dozens of log stumps on the banks of an inlet.)<br>
Narrator: A major Hydro dam was built on our territory in the 1950&rsquo;s.<br>
(A black and white photograph of the large dam construction site.)<br>
Narrator: The Myra Falls mine opened here in 1966. We were never consulted or adequately compensated for these resource developments.<br>
(A colour photograph of the mine, with the excavated hillside behind.)<br>
Chief Michael Maquinna: We&rsquo;re colonized to the hilt and we hope to decolonize ourselves from that. Hopefully, as time goes on, we can achieve decolonization.<br>
Narrator: In 1964, the Tahsis Company, opened a Pulp and Paper mill at Ahaminaquus near Gold River. Indian Affairs offered to build a new reserve for the band &ndash; 100 meters away from the mill.<br>
(Videos of the inside of the pulp mill, with large machinery.)<br>
Narrator: The band had agreed to move on the promise of the new jobs the mill would provide. Everyone was hopeful it would mark the start of a new modern time. But only a handful of us ever worked at the mill.<br>
(Film footage of the Ahaminaquus housing development in the 1990s.)<br>
(Margarita James is interviewed. She has a floral shirt, purple glasses, and gray hair pulled back. She sits in front of a bookshelf.)<br>
Margarita James: My son Jordan was just a baby and I had him in a carrier on our deck as we do, nice day. I thought it was a nice day until I turned to look at him and he had fines all over him. It was like flour or powder sugar, all over him. And I said to his dad, &ldquo;This is horrible.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s that mill.&rdquo;<br>
(Archival video of a Chief Jerry Jack pointing out an overhead photo of the reserve next to the mill.)<br>
Chief Jerry Jack: Because of our people&rsquo;s living conditions, here on the reserve has been another horror story. We are only living on 9 acres! This is the only piece of land we have left here. This here, and the mill leases out the rest. And a lot of our people are living in poverty here and we have a mill sitting right on our reserve. The smog and the smell and the noise. It&rsquo;s just been really&#8230; It&rsquo;s just been horrible, it&rsquo;s just been horrible.<br>
Margarita James: The mill during that time was horrific, like what Jerry Jack said, &ldquo;It was a horror story.&rdquo; Fines spewing out. The river, the fish were being affected &ndash; the stocks were being affected they&rsquo;d beien reduced to a handful.<br>
(Video of a small motor boat sailing past the pulp mill as it releases huge billows of emissions.)<br>
Margarita James: Just the conditions, the heavy trucks on the road&#8230; and just the water coming down from the river that we were drinking. There was no proper sewage system with the village of Gold River. It was just horrible, just horrible.</p>

<p>Chief Jerry Jack: And it had a really big psychological effect on our people, a really big psychological effect on them. And when we started moving back here it wasn&rsquo;t the same. Our people wasn&rsquo;t the same.<br>
Narrator: In the 1970s elected chief band counsellor Mary Johnson and hereditary chief Jerry Jack led a campaign to close the mill and compensate the band. It took almost 20 years to resolve.<br>
Margarita James: I came in 1982 as an interim band manager. There was an opportunity for a project about researching the files, and what came out of that project was files on the mill lease agreement, the history of it.<br>
Narrator: The research discovered that the government falsely claimed to have consulted with band members on the mill lease agreement. An environmental health inspection also pronounced a number of the homes at Ahaminaquus were &ldquo;unfit for human habitation&rdquo;.<br>
Margarita James: Our lawyers said this is not right, so we Mowachaht/Muchalaht filed a lawsuit against the Government of Canada. And it took 10 years to get our day in court. The council of chiefs signed the offer from the feds and the province for $9.6 million to relocate the 28 existing households on Ahaminaquus #12. &ldquo;Where do you want to move to?&rdquo; Everybody said, the majority of the people said, Yuquot. But the $9.6 was not enough to relocate the 28 homes, be able to provide schools, health services. So, we had to step back and ask what are our other options?<br>
(A map animated with arrows and dotted lines show the long distance by sea from Ahaminaquus to Yuquot) <br>
Narrator: In 1996 the Band agreed to move to a new reserve at TsaXana, north of Gold River. The Mill closed in 1999 following a number of environmental violations. But what was to become of Yuquot?<br>
Margarita James: It was Ambrose really, he recognized the importance of the global history, the world history at Yuquot. How everybody appreciated that European story because it really also emphasized the importance of Chief Maquinna and how important he was to the history of Canada. Maquinna was the first to say, &ldquo;We want to share Yuquot with the world.&rdquo; So how are we going to do that?<br>
(Uplifting music and contemporary videos of families boarding onto a boat.)<br>
Margarita James: What was established was an annual summer celebration. One day. And when we had the discussion with the Elders, it was decided that we would just celebrate everybody&rsquo;s history at Yuquot on that day. The first Summerfest was August 28th, 1992. And that day was a celebration of the meeting of Captain Vancouver, Chief Maquinna and the Spanish Captain Bodega y Quadra.<br>
(Video clips of the Summerfest in the 1990&rsquo;s until now.)<br>
Narrator: Other measures to encourage more tourists to visit Yuquot followed: In 1993, Chief Max Savey established a water taxi service for Yuquot and Nootka Sound. Later, six tourist cabins were built. Working with Parks Canada, the Elders developed a plan for Nis&rsquo;Maas &ndash; an interpretive center. At the center we want our people to be the storytellers, to remove the colonizer lens and provide visitors with an Indigenous perspective on our history.<br>
(Design sketches of Nis&rsquo;Maas. The buildings resemble long houses, with cases inside for cultural belongings.)</p>

<p>Margarita James: So that&rsquo;s the plans we have in Nis&rsquo;Maas. I just find it very interesting, awesome, and fabulous that we have that opportunity to do that and I hope it happens in my lifetime. <br>
(Margarita smiles and looks into the dstance.)<br>
Narrator: In 1923, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized Nootka Sound as a historic site. But the plaque they produced said nothing about Chief Maquinna or the Mowachaht people, or Yuquot. At the Summerfest in 2021, we celebrated with Parks Canada the arrival of a new plaque that tells our story from our perspective, about Yuquot, the center of our world - where the abundance and energy of the ocean meets the majesty and richness of the forest and inlets.<br>
(Contemporary video shots of Summerfest with tents pitched by the beach. Some videos of the carving of the new plaques. The video finishes with a pan out of the Yuquot welcome post and beach. Drumming and singing music plays.)</p>
